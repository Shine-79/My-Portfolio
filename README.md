# My-Portfolio
This portfolio will demonstrate my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
The portolio is self explanatory from the navigation bar to include the requirements of the assignment.
The home page has an image that is greyscale when you hover over it.
Code was taken and then modified from W3Schools and MDN.
